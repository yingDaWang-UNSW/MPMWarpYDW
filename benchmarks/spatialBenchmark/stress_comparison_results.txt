COUPLING TEST STRESS COMPARISON
======================================================================

SOLID (normal XPBD density):
  Bottom stress: -355.40 +/- 1724.23 kPa

LIGHT (10x lighter XPBD):
  Bottom stress: -222.47 +/- 904.63 kPa

DIFFERENCE:
  Delta: 132.93 kPa
  Relative: -37.4%

CONCLUSION: Reduced by 37.4% - expected behavior
